## The history of errors 
Bugs? How did error messages develop during the history of computers?
Error messages of other real life things?

## The layers of errors
In which layer of the computer is the error happening? In which layer of the code? How is it being translated from 0s and 1s to more and more human languages?

## Errors in society 
Productiviy, looking for errors in education 
Errors are considered as bad things. They are underlined with red. 

## Creativity and flow
We need confidence to create, if a computer is breaking it down any time we do something wrong, how to keep up?
Creative coding vs painting? 

## Psychology of errors
How to deal with problems? 
Interviews with coders? Are there different methods?

## UX copywriting
how to talk to humans

Sound, colour, smell, movement, glitch? who knows? 

## Little mindtrip: what if error messages would appear in other parts of our real life?
in relationships, while cooking, while speaking a new language. 

## Proposal for error message system for beginner creative coders
Closer to the humans.

## Technical implementation? 
Hujuj, this seems hard, but I can probably do it.
